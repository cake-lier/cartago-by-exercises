# JaCaMo by exercises

The repository containing all the exercises for learning the JaCaMo framework in depth.

## What?

This is the main repository hosting all exercises recommended to learn the JaCaMo framework in depth.
All the exercises are borrowed from the handbook "CArtAgO by examples" which can be found at this [link](https://github.com/CArtAgO-lang/cartago/blob/master/docs/cartago_by_examples/cartago_by_examples.pdf).
The effort put into this work is to transform the examples into doable exercises, without having the solution right away,
stimulating the student to find a solution themselves, possibly even better than the one suggested.
For every exercise, a template for the files to create is given and their filling is left to the student.
A solution is also given, but the explanation can be found in the manual linked above or, even better, in the official documentation.

## How to do the exercises?

You have to clone this repository with all its submodules using the command

```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:cake-lier/jacamo-by-exercises.git
```

Nothing else is required, all of them just work out of the box. So, enjoy playing with JaCaMo!
